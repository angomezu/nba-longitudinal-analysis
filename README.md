Longitudinal data analysis of NBA player performance using Generalized Estimating Equations in SAS.

This project analyzes how NBA players' scoring performance evolves over their careers using longitudinal methods, specifically Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) in SAS.

## Project Structure

- `data/all_seasons.csv`: Cleaned dataset with NBA player stats from 1996–2022
- `code/Longitudinal_Data_Modeling.sas`: SAS code for performing GEE analysis
- `report/AngelBarrera_Project_2.pdf`: Final report with analysis, results, and interpretation

## Summary

Using a population-averaged model (GEE), we studied how points per game (PPG) vary with player age and season. The dataset includes over 12,000 player-season records, and the model shows small but significant increases in scoring with both age and year.

## Tools

- SAS (PROC GENMOD for GEE)
- CSV data cleaning and prep
